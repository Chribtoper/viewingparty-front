## Backend can be found here. It uses postGRESQL https://github.com/Chribtoper/viewingparty-backend/tree/master/app
Master branch is currently built to only operate with my heroku hosted backend.
Check out a demo of this active project https://viewing-party-app.herokuapp.com

## What is Viewing Party?
The Viewing party project was inspired from the times where i'd be watching youtube videos with my friends and want to watch videos in sync. Some of the functionality/visuals is inspired off twitch.tv. If I can watch live streams with friends, why not watch youtube videos in sync wit hfriends? 

With this app you can create/join rooms that users have made that include a youtube player, a queue and a chatroom. The first person to join the room is the host and can control what videos will play, the time of the videos, the choice to delete videos etc. The videos will always be in sync with the hosts clients through some janky fun websocket tricks ;)
